# httpshd

[![Build](https://github.com/gavv/httpshd/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gavv/httpshd/actions)

`httpshd` is a tiny HTTP server that reads shell command from request body, executes it, and sends its output via HTTP response.

There are two features for better support of interactivity:

* command is executed inside a PTY
* command output is not buffered, chunked transfer encoding is used

Thanks to this, the output of a long-running command is delivered to the client immediately.

## Security warning

This program is absolutely insecure!

There is neither encryption, nor authentication currently. Anyone can execute any command with the permissions of the user which is running `httpshd`. Hence, it's recommended to use it only within private networks.

## Installation

First, install [recent Go](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu) (at least 1.14 is needed):

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-go
```

This will download, build, and install `httpshd` executable into `$GOPATH/bin` (it's `~/go/bin` if `GOPATH` environment variable is not set):

```
go get github.com/gavv/httpshd
```

Alternatively, you can install from sources:

```
git clone https://github.com/gavv/httpshd.git
cd httpshd
go build
./httpshd -help
```

## Example

Server:

```
$ ./httpshd
21:00:03.585 starting server at 0.0.0.0:3333
21:00:14.734 [127.0.0.1:37786] executing command: /bin/zsh -c "ls -l"
21:00:14.741 [127.0.0.1:37786] success
...
```

Client:

```
$ echo "ls -l" | curl -XPOST -d @- -s http://127.0.0.1:3333

## Motivation

I created this program because I needed to run compilation on macOS remotely from my Linux box. Unfortunately, Xcode toolchain has many difficulties with SSH, and some build steps like app signing just didn't work even with some well-known workarounds.

Meanwhile, just sending commands to `nc` connected to `sh` worked, given that `nc` is started inside an intera—Åtive session (i.e. you login, open terminal, and run it). The reason is that `nc`, as well as `httpshd`, and unlike `sshd`, doesn't create a new user session, which is handled specially by the OS.

Since `nc` is not very handy for this specific use case, this tool was created.
